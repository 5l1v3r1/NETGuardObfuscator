## **Step 3 - Missing Dependencies Page**

In the case where your project relies on different external dependencies \(.dll library files\) you will be sent to the **Missing Dependencies Page**. On this page, you are only asked to select those external dependencies files so NETGuard can process the obfuscation task. Due to the nature of the process we are to ask you to agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms Of Use.

After that you will be redirected to the **Obfuscation Output page** to download your protected file.

![Select your external dll files and accept our TOS/PP, and then click &apos;upload dependencies&apos;](.gitbook/assets/004.png)

## Step 4 - Obfuscation Output Page

On this page you will be able to download your obfuscated main file alone of with its original external dependencies, all packed in a .zip file \(Windows handle them by default\). This is conveniant in the case you have multiple versions of these external library dependencies.

You have access to the selected features on the right, and the obfuscation engines log un the accordion menu.
