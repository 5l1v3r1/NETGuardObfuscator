# Protections

## Getting your code obfuscated

In order to obfuscate your file's code you need our Desktop Application : 

```
https://netguard.io/api/desktop_app.7z
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Our application is not digitally signed yet, so antivirus might report a false positive threat. 
{% endhint %}
