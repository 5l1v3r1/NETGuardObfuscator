# How do I become  βeta member ?

To be eligible to the βeta membership, you must fulfill certain conditions :

* Own a reputable service / program \(&gt;100 regular users\).
* Allow us to use your service / program logo on our index page.
* Write a 20 words review for us to use on our index page.

If you fullfill those requirements then please do contact us and let's chat about your possible βeta membership. The last decision is made by the technical team, yet the older your account is the more chance you have to be approved.

**βeta membership costs nothing** : you pay for tokens, you only have more protection features available.
