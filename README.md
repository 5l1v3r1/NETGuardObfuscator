# Presentation
NETGuard.IO is a **SaaS cloud-based obfuscator for files compiled for the Microsoft .NET Framework (2.0->4.8)** since 2014 ! Microsoft .NET compiled files are easily decompilable, it means that people can look at your source code and even modify it or exporting it to a new project source code, puting your source code at critical risks. 
**Obfuscation is one possible security layer you can use** combined with authentication system and piracy prevention system. Obfuscation will increase the entropy in your file in order to **complexify your source code while preserving the original tasks** performed by your file, **keepig hackers at bay** ! I usually take two very basic exemples : 

 - Take a puzzle, take apart its pieces slowly, and rebuild the puzzle. This is hackers playing with your file, easy peasy lemon sqeezy.
 - Take that same puzzle, take apart its pieces, mix them up really hard randomly, cut some of them out, and try to rebuild the puzzle. This is hackers playing with your obfuscated file, significantly harder

# How it works
Microsoft .NET Framework compiled file follow the [ECMA standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm), compiled into the Microsoft Intermediate Language MSIL, basically a scripting stack-based language. With high-end library such as [dnLib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib) we are able to modify the MSIL representation of your source code directly on the compiled file, accessing the MSIL language operand in your file in a list format. 
**NETGuard.IO will modify this list content (your compiled source code) up to a point where the original task is executed but the list flow is not transparent and straightforward anymore.**
