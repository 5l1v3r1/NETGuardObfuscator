# Native Shield

NETGuard.IO can wrap your file into a Native Delphi PE file, preventing decompilers and managed debuggers. 

This feature is fully compatible with x64 and x32 managed assembly ; make sure your file is either x64 or x32 but not AnyCPU. 

This protection does not handle library \(.dll\) files, only executable \(.exe\) managed file.
