# Anti Debugger Protection

 NETGuard.IO can prevent your file from being debugger by debugging tools and decompilers. We use WinAPI and managed techniques to prevent your file from being ran if a debugger is detected on the computer. We automatically remove the file from the computer if a debugger is found in order to prevent any attempt at tampering your file.
